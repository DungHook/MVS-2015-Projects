# MVS-2015-Projects
My learning C# projects

The goal of this project is to understand how to use Git.
Mainly;
How to host a free uo shard on a vps, as if I new what I was doing.
***********Work Flow**********
1/ If you have your shard hosted in a private GIT  repository, 
       1a/   you can install  GIT on the server machine itself 
        1b/  and chekout your shard's repository on the VPS in 
        the same way that you can with your local PC.

2/ You then simply commit your changes on your local PC to your repository,
3/ then pull them on the VPS, voilla!
                           *******

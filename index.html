			We have <strong>no repair deeds</strong>. This was done to give the crafters a stronger role in the society.  If you need armor, or just need armor repaired, get to know a good crafter. 
			Not everyone wants to invest the time into building a A good crafter.</p>
		<p> For those that do, they will build a loyal following. Total skills cap set to 800. The thoughts here are we can have the standared 5 skills at 120. Plus one extra skill at 80.
This was to help the templets that are slap full and  still keep the sence of comunity.

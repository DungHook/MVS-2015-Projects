					<h1>Knights Templar</h1>
		<h3>An Ultima Online Free Shard</h3>
	 
		<h3> Old school values; </h3>
		<p>
			We have <strong>no repair deeds</strong>. This was done to give the crafters a stronger role in the society.<b>  If you need armor, or just need armor repaired, get to know a good crafter. 
			Not everyone wants to invest the time into building a A good crafter.
			</p>
		<p> For those that do, they will build a loyal following.
			</p> 
		<h3>Total skills cap set to 800. </h3>
		<p>	The thoughts here is, if we keep the standared 5 skills at 120 max with a powerscroll.
			<b> We can have one extra skill at 80.	This was to help the templets that are slap full. Keeping a roleplay feel to the template.  
			<b> A temlplate hase no identity when you take away skillcaps all together.
			</p>
			<p> With no skill caps every character can do everything, compleetly looseing there identity.</p>

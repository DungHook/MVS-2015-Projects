	<h1>Knights Templar</h1>
	<h3>An Ultima Online Free Shard</h3>
	 
		<h3> Old school values; </h3>
		<p>
			We have <strong>no repair deeds</strong>. This was done to give the crafters a stronger role in the society.  If you need armor, or just need armor repaired, get to know a good crafter. 
			Not everyone wants to invest the time into building a A good crafter.
			</p>
		<p> For those that do, they will build a loyal following.
			</p> 
		<p>	Total skills cap set to 800. The thoughts here are we can have the standared 5 skills at 120. Plus one extra skill at 80.
			This was to help the templets that are slap full and  still keep the sence of comunity.
